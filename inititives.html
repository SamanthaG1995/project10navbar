    <h1>Inititives</h1>
    <p class='p4'>Specific actions are researched, planned and promoted within the school community via meaningful
      student lead interest groups, curriculum, management and day to day operations of the school. Students
      decision-making drives change for sustainable outcomes.
      Teams of students supported by staff mentors are empowered to lead and sustain initiatives developed through
      learning. Ensure social inclusion to enable members of the school community to participate fully in school life
      while instilling a long-lasting respect for human rights, freedoms, cultures and creative expression. Endeavor to
      practice global citizenship, enriching our educational mission with activities and partnerships that improve the
      lives of people living in other parts of the world.

    <p class='p5'>
      Encourage an interactive process of becoming aware of and practicing healthy choices to create a more successful
      and sustainable lifestyle nurturing people and nature, now and in the future. Promoting awareness of multiple
      aspects of wellbeing including emotional, physical, social, environmental, occupational, spiritual and
      intellectual. Create sustainable partnerships with the local community, engaging collaboratively with people and
      organizations to improve the environment and quality of life. Create greater awareness and participation in
      Rangiâ€™s sustainability and service initiatives through education, communication and collaboration within the

    <p class='p6'> We are seeking funding and the opportunity to work alongside business to design and install a
      biodigestoronsite. This will allow Rangi to convert green waste to biogas (to replace non-renewable natural gas
      currently used for cooking in the Boarding House and heating in Te Korohaand the pool). This investment enables
      substantial economic savings of which 60% will be reinvested into sustainability projects once establishment costs
      are covered after twenty six months.</p>
