    <h1>Sustainability Council at Rangi</h1>
    <p class='p1'>Rangi Ruru demonstrates responsible practices for our young people, staff and
      communities through actively engaging them in learning and positive actions. Rangi Ruru is proud to be an
      Enviroschool, a Fairtrade School, a KNZB Sustainable Schools Award finalist, and a finalist in the New Zealand
      Sustainable Business Network Awards. Individual students have also been awarded a wide range of sustainability
      awards and our students mentor other schools on how to lead sustainable change. Onsite we have an Eco-Action
      Nursery run by students cultivating thousands of native trees and plants to form a corridor through the
      Christchurch Ōtautahi red zone. This collaborative regeneration initiative with other schools, CCC and businesses,
      provides carbon sequestration, food and habitat for native birds. Students are taught environmentalism and
      ecological principles.
    </p>

    <p class='p2'>Our students support others in our community. Vegetables are grown onsite and given to our local
      Women’s Refuge Centre for use in safe houses. Clothes, shoes, toiletries, toys and books are collected in our
      Reuse Depot and donated. In the past three years, the Rangi Ruru Reuse Depot has collected and redistributed over
      one hundred thousand reusable items, ranging from cell phones to egg cartons. In doing this we have disrupted the
      take-make-waste model, reduced waste to landfill by 58% and donated money raised to Cool Earth, thus protecting an
      area of rainforest and communities living in them.
    </p>

    <p class='p3'>We pride ourselves in being a water only school with onsite production of fresh, nutritious meals,
      thus significantly reducing waste and providing healthy food and drink. Compostable and Fairtrade products are
      used where available in our dining room. We use free range eggs and have adopted ‘Meatless Monday’s’ in the dining
      room. We were honoured to have Jane Goodall and her New Zealand Foundation spend time at Rangi in 2019. We hosted
      a Youth Environmental Leaders forum with representatives from across New Zealand at Rangi and have held a number
      of Canterbury Sustainability hui onsite. Students in both the junior and senior school lead initiatives and foster
      relationships with tertiary institutions, NGO’s and businesses to find solutions to sustainable challenges. Our
      Environment Club and Sustainability Council provide opportunities for students and staff to be involved in taking
      action and showing a strong sense of care for our planet. </p>
